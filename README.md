# Welcome to 220228 Java Fullstack GCP!
This is the training repository for the Java Fullstack GCP batch starting February 28, 2022. All of the notes, demos, study guides, project guidelines, and other resources will be found here.

> QC is important, because it is intended as a way to simulate the interview process. Therefore, to set yourself up for success, check out this [guide on how to do well](./how-to-do-well-in-qc.md)

### The environment setup guide can be found [here](https://github.com/java-gcp-220228/environment-setup-guide)

## Weekly Expectations:
* Training starts everyday at 10:00AM EST and ends at 6:00PM EST
    - You are expected to be on time each day
* Lunch breaks happen everyday at 1:00PM EST to 2:00PM EST

### Evaluations

* Every Monday at 10:00 AM EST is when we will have a quiz that lasts for approximately 1 hour.
    > Quizzes serve more as a way to review the material covered in the prior week.
* One-on-ones (or sometimes group interviews) will take place starting at the beginning of each week
    - One-on-ones are sessions with me where you will be asked technical questions
    - Often, these one-on-ones will be conducted in a group setting to save time
* QC will be conducted every week over prior weeks' topics (usually the content covered the week before)
